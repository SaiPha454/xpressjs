# Xpressjs
## Expressjs internal workflow
Xpressjs is a small source code of Expressjs core features that I mimic. The purpose of the project is give the upper level of expressjs internal code flow to those who want to read Expressjs source code.
As diving into the expressjs source code directly without any pre-understanding can chew your time especially when there a lot of more extra features that you don't want to focus on. Hope this project can walk you through that.

PS. Another simplify tutorial that can walk you through reading expressjs source code : https://devtools.tech/blog/build-your-own-expressjs-or-part-1---rid---qoos1dgnByAcEaCp2rbl
